                <h2> CARISSA MASHINTA KURNIAWAN</h2>
                <p> I'm from Indonesia. I moved to London last year to continue my Master degree. I graduated from <br> MSc Business Analytics at University College London in September 2022. Please see the website of my University in this <a href = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/business-analytics-msc"> link</a>. Eventhough I have not get all my module marks yet, I considered my self graduated :D As you can see on the left, my graduation photoshot :) 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Before THG, I worked in Indonesia for the past 6 years. I started my career at Unilever as an Assistant Brand Manager. Working at Unilever was very competitive, was not really my favorite experience.
                     Therefore, I decided to move to Lazada (an Alibaba Group Company) as a Category Manager. Lazada is one of the biggest eCommerce platform in Southeast Asia!
                     I was having so much fun at Lazada! I spent 2 happy years at Lazada.
                     Soon after that, I decided to join Wunderman Thompson Commerce as an eCommerce Manager before I came to UK for study.
                     At Wunderman Thompson Commerce, I developed my leadership skill a lot!

                <h3> The land of Ice and Fire</h3>
                <p> I love travelling so much! 
                    Planning of where to go next motivates me to wake up and earn money everyday.
                    I feel calm and free when I visit new places. The curiosity inside me is telling me to keep wander around the world.
                    And I will never stop looking for new places.

                    Iceland, is one of the most impressive place I have ever been so far.
                    There are so much strangely beautiful landscape to explore in Iceland.
                    The land magically bring calm and heal my soul. 
                    I am going back to Iceland next summer and I am opening a collaboration proposal.
                    I call this trip "Expedition Happiness".
                    It can be anything! Product photoshot, landscape photoshot, or even travelling buddy.
                    Feel free to reach me our if you are interested!
